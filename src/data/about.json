        "paragraph1": "My journey into software development started not too long ago, but my love for computers and technology has been around since I could type on a keyboard. Like many of us, I grew up surrounded by technology, and my life from childhood to adulthood has been shaped by the ever-changing landscape of technological advancement.",
        "paragraph2": "I've always had a love for the sciences, which is why I chose to major in life sciences for my undergraduate degree and went into a career in biotechnology. A couple years into my lab career and while I was content, it still felt like something was missing. Programming was something I had always been curious about, but never pursued.",
        "paragraph3": "Finally, I tried my hand at learning some basic coding a few years ago, and it was like a spark lit in my brain -- this is something I could do. After much deliberation, I took a leap and fully committed to learning software development and to transitioning careers.",
        "paragraph4": "Though my journey is still just beginning, I am thrilled to continue learning and developing my skills each and every day.",
        "paragraph5": "Some of my hobbies include cooking, art, video games, and traveling. Hoping to add more to this list as time goes on!",
        "paragraph6": "If you've read this far -- thank you! I hope you enjoyed learning a little about me and please reach out so we can get to know each other more :)"
